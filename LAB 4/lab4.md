# Pong Game

Here, we have implemented the pong game using the ATmega328p, ESP32, Adafruit 358 1.8" TFT LCD with ST7735R chip as the display and peripherals such as joystick (for controlling the paddles of the player) and passive buzzer for providing an audio-visual experience for the user. 
The game can also be played wirelessly using Blynk Application as the mode of control for the paddle.
There are multiple levels of difficulty in the game which can be controlled by the user. Randomization of speed and direction of the ball signify the change in level of difficulty.

There are 2 modes:
1. Player vs. Computer
2. Player vs. Player

The library for graphics (LCD_GFX) is written from scratch.

Here are links to videos demonstrating the working of the entire setup:
